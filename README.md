# Motherly by BabySPA

#### Tagline: 
Connect as Mothers <br>
Baby's Edge to be Healther, Smater and Sociable 

#### Main Concept Idea

The BabySPA app is more than just making booking sessions easier. It is about recognising the pain point that millions of women encounter and finding a right solution for every indivual mother. Motherhood can be challenging, and Motherly app by BabySPA focus to help mothers overcome and empower them to unite.<br>
Booking sessions for BabySPA services such as water training, baby massage and baby haircut can be done through the Motherly app.<br>

Mothers can now discover a community of like-minded mothers near them and start messaging and create group conversations among themselves. The App also introduces a forum for mothers to save bright moments for their babies. For example, mothers could upload their daily blogs of their babies, sharing tips and tricks for new mothers, articles of parenthood etc. Furthermore, a personal calender is included to update and notify mothers of their baby's swimming appointments or even baby contests!
